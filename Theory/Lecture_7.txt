What are various ways to add images into our App? Explain with code examples

Using the import Keyword
You can import a file right in a JavaScript module. This tells a webpack to include that file in the bundle

Using the require Keyword
We can also use the require keyword to load the images into your component. In that case, your code should look like this:
<img src={require('./house.jpg)} alt=''/>


What would happen if we do console.log(useState())?
It will log the [undefined, f()]


How will useEffect behave if we don't add a dependency array ?

Giving it an empty array acts like componentDidMount as in, it only runs once.

Giving it no second argument acts as both componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate, as in it runs first on mount 
and then on every re-render.

Giving it an array as second argument with any value inside, eg , [variable1] will only execute the code inside 
your useEffect hook ONCE on mount, as well as whenever that particular variable (variable1) changes.
