Behind the Scenes of JSX

To make easy coding react introduced JSX. It is an JavaScript extension 
where we can embed valid JavaScript objects into HTML elements. JSX makes Code
easier to read and understand. Usually, HTML and JavaScript is written separately but 
react creates components that contain both HTML and JavaScript

const age = 20;
const ele = <h1> I'm {age} years old </h1>;

Whenever a code is written in JSX, babel transcompile the code into JavaScript code.


Babel and Parcel Role in JSX

To compile JSX into React.createElement API calls
To compile bleeding-edge JavaScript into something that most browsers can understand

Parcel supports JSX automatically when it detects you are using React. If youâ€™re using React 
17 or later, it also automatically enables the modern JSX transform, which means you don't 
even need to import React for JSX to work, as you can see in App.js in the above example.


Components

Components are the building blocks of the react they are independent and reusable bits of code.
They serves the same purpose as JavaScript functions but work in isolation and return JSX which
is then converted to HTML

functional components

Functional components are basic JavaScript functions. These are typically arrow functions but
can also be created with the regular function keyword.
