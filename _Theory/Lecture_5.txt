Difference between named export, default export and * as export

Named export is used when we are exporting multiple things from a file 
then all the things will be exported as object and can be destructured to use them individually

default export is used when we are exporting only one thing from the file 
and that thing can be used as it is

* as Name export is used when we are exporting everyting in the file wiht the help of Name. 
we can use each and every exported component and function

Importance of Config.js
we don't have to redeclare same data and variables we can declare it in one place and export it 
it can be reused throughout the project


What are hooks
React Hooks are simple JavaScript functions that we can use to isolate the reusable part
from a functional component. Hooks can be stateful and can manage side-effects. React 
provides a bunch of standard in-built hooks: 

useState : To manage states. Returns a stateful value and an updater function to update it.
